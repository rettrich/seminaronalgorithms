abstract="The Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) is a conjecture stating that, roughly speaking, n-variable 3-SAT cannot be solved in time 2o(n). In this chapter, we prove lower bounds based on ETH for the time needed to solve various problems. In many cases, these lower bounds match (up to small factors) the running time of the best known algorithms for the problem.",

annotate = "This chapter of the book Parameterized Algorithms discusses the connection of fixed-parameter tractability and the Exponential-Time Hypothesis, which is the assumption that 3-SAT cannot be solved in subexponential time. Using this hypothesis, lower bounds for the runtime of various problems that are connected to 3-SAT can be shown, which also includes fixed-parameter intractibility results."

abstract="A backdoor set is a set of variables of a propositional formula such that fixing the truth values of the variables in the backdoor set moves the formula into some polynomial-time decidable class. If we know a small backdoor set we can reduce the question of whether the given formula is satisfiable to the same question for one or several easy formulas that belong to the tractable class under consideration. In this survey we review parameterized complexity results for problems that arise in the context of backdoor sets, such as the problem of finding a backdoor set of size at most k, parameterized by k. We also discuss recent results on backdoor sets for problems that are beyond NP.",
